computers ahvae  problem with floats when we do 0.1+0.2 it comes out all weird, 0.30000000000000004, WHY? computers store numbers in 0 and 1, tho this doesnt happen with all floats

typeof for knowing the datatype of variable
adding a string and a number is known as type coercion or automatic type conversion, coz the number is converted to string

3 ways to create a string:
    'hello' default
    "hello"
    `hello` known as template strings, tehy have special feature:
        interpolation: `Items (${1+1}): $${(2095+799)/100}` much cleaner than concaetanation: 'Items(' + (1+1)+ '):$'+ (2095 + 799)/100

        multple strings: `some
                        text`
                                    'some\ntext'

escape characters \' or \" or \n which means new line, means just one character like

a web page is a single page, multiple web pages form a website
<button title="tooltip"> text shown when we hover over a button

pascal case: OkayGot
kebab-case: okay-got use thisin html css not js
snake_case: okay_got

let and var:
    oriiginal way to create variable tho it has issues.
typeof
==, only content conerts both the values into same type
===, checks the datatype as well

an algo is a step of taks to complete a problem
Math.random() chooose number between 0 and 1
var doesnt follow the scope if i have one var outside scope defiend with a then ic ant defien another var a in scope

TRUTHY AND FALSEY VALUES:
truuthy: 5 rest
falsey: 0 false  '' NaN undefined null
    Nan: wehn we do invalid math
    undefined: something that doesnt have a value,
        we can do let var1. then var1 will ahev undefiend value
        for const var1= undefined, we hvae todo so

we can save the result fo ternary in a variable
    const result= 0? 'truthy' : 'false'
guard operator: && shortcut evaluation
    const message= 5 && 'hello', message will have value hello in it
default operator:  if one is true we know it will do!
 const curr= 'eru' || 'usd' pnow curr will have  eru
