#another thing
margin is space around element
padding: inside element

html entity is for special characters
css-specificity, there is a priority stuling is done, it depends on selector the one whihc is more specific has more priority

texte lement, just modiies a part of text like u and strong, span

when we set the width of image1 the height also changes to keep teh saem shape of image1

object-fit to cover the whole image1 in some constraint dimensions, similarly we have object-position

we have three elements:
    black element: takes whole line
    inline block elemneT: tkaes only as much space they need to
    inline element, like strong
    
    we use display to switch between these 

if elemnt is is display block then center nahi chalega, div me daaloa nd venter kardo!

font weifht: regular 400, medium 500, bold 700

readme helps to have aligned horizontal layouts
